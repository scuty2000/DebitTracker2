# DebitTracker2

## Premise

This is a remake of an old project called "Debit Tracker", used to keep trace of "debits" people have with you.

## Developing notes

I'm using this project to study how the new SwiftUI framework works vs the old UIKit.
It seems to be pretty nice and versatile way to manage the UI, also given the cross-Apple platform native compatibility.
